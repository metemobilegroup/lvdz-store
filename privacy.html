      <h4>Overview</h4>
      <p>This Privacy Policy explains the data handled by <strong>Bnk Studio</strong> (‘we’, ’us’, ‘our’) via our mobile applications, websites, and related services. By accessing or using our mobile apps or affiliated sites, you agree to the guidelines and practices outlined in this policy.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h5>Information Collection and Use</h5>
      <p>Upon downloading and utilizing our mobile apps, we do not require you to provide personal details, and we do not gather user-provided info. However, the application uses third-party tools that may collect certain data automatically, according to their own privacy standards.</p>

      <h5>Children’s Privacy (COPPA & GDPR Compliance)</h5>
      <p>Our applications are designed for children. We strictly comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We do not collect, request, or store any personal information from children under the age of 13. To ensure a safe environment, we implement a mandatory <b>Parental Gate</b> before allowing access to external links or commercial transactions (In-App Purchases).</p>

      <p>We do not provide personally identifiable data (like names or phone numbers) to external companies. Non-personal technical information is only shared with the third-party providers listed in this policy to ensure app functionality, performance monitoring, and contextual advertising in compliance with children's privacy regulations.</p>

    <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
    
    <div class="section">
      <p>By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions.</p>
      
      <p>We are committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.</p>

      <p><b>In-App Purchases & Restore:</b> The app may offer digital products. All commercial transactions are protected by a <b>Parental Gate</b> requiring adult verification. A <b>Restore Purchases</b> feature is provided within the app to allow users to regain access to previously purchased non-consumable content on the same platform store.</p>

      <p>It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the app won’t work properly or at all.</p>

      <p>The app does use third-party services that declare their Terms and Conditions. Link to Terms and Conditions of third-party service providers used by the app:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/admob/terms">AdMob</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms/analytics">Google Analytics for Firebase</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms/crashlytics">Firebase Crashlytics</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://unity3d.com/legal/terms-of-service">Unity</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.applovin.com/terms/">AppLovin</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>You should be aware that there are certain things that we will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but we cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.</p>

      <p>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.</p>

      <p>With respect to our responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. We accept no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p>

      <p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The requirements for the system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. We do not promise that we will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the version that you have installed on your device. We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.</p>

      <h5>Changes to this Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions</h5>
      <p>We may update our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions from time to time. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.</p>
